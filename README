Resume was created using:
- YAML source - for the resume content
- LaTeX template - for presentation and layout
- Python script and Jinja2 (templating engine) for compiling together the
  YAML and LaTeX
- pdflatex for .tex --> .pdf
- GNU Make for compilation
- Vim and git


The purpose is to avoid data duplication and to separate content from
presentation. For example, I can now create an HTML resume by writing just a
CSS + HTML template without having to copy-paste job descriptions, etc. Editing
and updating is restricted to just one place - the YAML source.


Rough instructions (will update as a blog post when I roll a blog engine):

0. Install the OS dependencies: LaTeX, Python, Make, etc.
1. Create your virtualenv and install Python dependencies:
    virtualenv venv
    source venv\bin\activate (linux)
    venv\bin\activate.bat (windows)
    pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Write resume in YAML format
3. Compile, preview, and edit.
    make


TODO:
  - create the txt template
